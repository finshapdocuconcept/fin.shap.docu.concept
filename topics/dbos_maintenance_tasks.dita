    <title>DBOS Maintenance Tasks</title>
    <body>
        <p>Today, mature tooling, such as package management or provisioning tools, covers the
            installation and deployment of applications. But is there tooling available for managing
            an application? How are operational tasks covered? Software operators are the
            answer.</p>
        <p>The software operator is a design pattern, a proven approach to implement real-world
            operation tasks with source code. Software operators cover configuration, updating,
            scaling, running backups or performing health checks.</p>
        <p>Because they are the beating heart of organisationsâ€™ IT, they have more sophisticated
            transparency, reliability and data security requirements. How do you go about developing
            them? Join our webinar for best practices.</p>
