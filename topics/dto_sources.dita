    <title>DTO and their types</title>
    <shortdesc>This section may be useful for front-end developers, business and technical
        analytics, pre-sales, sales and even marketing to some point. Data Transfer Object (DTO)
        usually use to simplify calling data and function that are needed to handle specific task
        and run needed functions.</shortdesc>
    <body>
        <p>We consider for DTO some container for all data and functions that are needed to handle
            specific function as a step of a bigger business task. Business task in this context
            means any task that may be done by using Digital Banking solution. DTO comprise data and
            functions from any data sources and provide all needed information to operate with those
            data and functions that are the parts of this specific DTO. One DTO may be connected to
            more than one function or task at the same time. Many DTO may be connected to one task
            as far as task may comprise several functions (steps).</p>
        <p>We assume DTO types with the same way as Functions and Tasks to simplify their
            interconnection and relationship understanding:</p>
